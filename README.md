# Quiet-Time-Diamond-Collector
The Quiet Time Diamond Collector is an interactive classroom management tool designed to create an engaging and focused learning environment during deliberate practice and independent work.

By harnessing both positive reinforcement (earning diamonds and achievement badges) and gentle corrective feedback (losing hearts when the noise level rises), the program motivates students to work in silence and take responsibility for their own behaviour.

# Key Features

🎤 Real-time noise tracking using the classroom microphone.

💎 Diamonds are earned continuously while the class remains quiet.

🏅 Badge system (Bronze → Netherite) rewards sustained focus with celebratory animations.

❤️ Hearts represent collective “chances” that are lost when the class gets too noisy.

🔧 Customisable settings:

Adjustable noise threshold

Diamond earning interval

Number of hearts

Grace period before penalties are applied

🛡️ Immunity period after earning a badge, allowing students to celebrate briefly.

🔄 Reset & restore controls to restart sessions or replenish hearts.

# Purpose

The program promotes a positive and accountable learning culture, where students are encouraged to maintain silence through clear, visual feedback and gamified reinforcement. Teachers can use it to support independent work routines, exam-style practice sessions, or any time that requires collective focus.
